Made some more progress recently on some key things:

- Indicator can go to any hex vertice
- Performance is genrally better (less new images being made every frame)
- Placing a randomly 'colored' settlement meeple on a hex vertice when you hit A

And now that I've taken this first stab at these isometric settlement icons,
it's proven to be tricky. After some iteration I _kind of_ have a set of 4
patterns that look different enough that I think i oculd get away with it barely
on the small PD screen, but they're kinda chunky and take up a good amount of
area (not gonna leave a lot of room for roads).

So I think it's time to brainstorm more abstract ways of representing player
tokens, although I'm also tempted to just take this to it's conclusion and make
some quick isometric roads and cities to see how those look in context. I can
say now that I'd def need to implement some kind of 'front to back' rendering
order to ensure stuff looks right.
