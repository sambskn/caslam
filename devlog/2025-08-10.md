First devlog for thsi prject, though maybe like day 7-ish (very on and off) of
working on it and toying with it.

At this point I'm starting to see the shape of the gaem come together more, even
if it's just tile generation with static ports and fake player stats.

Will be exciting to make the indicator more versatile to hit all hex vertices
and also road locations. I think that and some simple sprite drawing for houses
and roads (haha yeah... simple for sure...) and actual wired up stuff for
victory points at least, and boom, we'll have initial placement stuff (almost)
there, which is bascially the whole game anyway lol. Love to see that amount of
qualifiers in a single run on sentance :)

One nice positive is that when i showed off my tiles to the gang in discord they
could figure out which is which (though there's probably another iteration or
two for the wood and sheep tiles)
