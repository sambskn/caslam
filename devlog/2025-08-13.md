Adjusted settlement sprite to use the saem patters we made yesterday, but just
in a 2d square. Still not sure wha the city should be initcated by tho. Maybe it
could go from cirlce for a settlemtn to square for a city? Or maybe I could add
an underlaid square roated 45 deg for cities? Could also just add like a circle
around the city or doubel border the square.

Even reducing the size mad down from yesterday they're still just large enough
that there's a chace port positions might not be clear enough if a settlement is
placed there. Arguably that doesn't matter sooooo much? Since if someone is on a
port nobody else is allowed to get the other spot. I think doing something more
than just the simple lines would be nice tho. Depends too on what will be
visible against any possible background we'll have (animated waves :eyball
emoji!!!:)

Important things to do next:

- modify indicator to support road placement
- make basic road sprite, place it
- [stretch goal] set up the whole initial placement sequence?????
